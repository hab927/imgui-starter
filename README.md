# Logging System Basics

# Approach
**Platform used: Windows**

The general approach that I took to writing this code was by messing around with the demo window. I also took a look at the example Debug Log window provided by the Demo Window that is created on default.

I also consulted the imgui docs on the source Dear Imgui repository and corresponding StackOverflow posts. Most of the work I did was largely by trial and error and cursory research. I also had to spend a decent chunk of time familiarizing myself with C++ again, since it's been 2 years since I used the language. 

# Clarifying Questions

I asked Professor Devine for the meaning of two of the rubric items, those two being "Contains levels of logging" and "Can set level of log to console". According to the professor, this means controlling what types of log messages show up, like filtering options.
